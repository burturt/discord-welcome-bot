# discord-welcome-bot
In ACM Cyber, we have a tradition of waving to every single person who joins our discord, giving that extra personal welcome to the server that a bot could never do. Continuing this to LA CTF, it would be extremely difficult to wave to everyone manually without missing anyone. Enter this bot: it will tell you who hasn't been waved at yet, and provide direct message links that allow you to quickly jump to the message and give that personal greeting!

Note: this discord bot is not built to handle more than one channel, and aggressively caches messages to limit the amount of message history necessary to operate. As such, doing things like deleting wave messages may cause "ghost" messages to not be checked.
